Materials used in tutorials will be hosted here for COMP90016 - Computational Genomics (Sem 1 2019)

To launch Binder:

* JupyterLab: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bhuvad/comp90016_2019/master?urlpath=lab)
* Jupyter Notebook: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bhuvad/comp90016_2019/master)

Binder will let you play with notebooks in a temporary environment.
